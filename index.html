    <p>On May 6, Walter B. Jones (R), the House representative from North Carolina&#146;s third district, will compete for the seat he&#146;s held for 19 years. This year, Jones, a conservative Republican, is facing two primary opponents&#151;an uncommon, though not unheard of, occurrence for a seasoned incumbent. Much of the criticism coming from the two opponents, Taylor Griffin and Al Novinec, centers around Jones&#146; voting record&#151;Jones has only voted with his party 74% of the time during the current Congress. </p>

    <p>Griffin, in particular, has targeted Jones for his voting record, which usually diverges from the Republican majority when it comes to war. Jones, who represents the district Camp Lejeune is in, largely stopped voting with House Republicans around 10 years ago at the start of the Iraq War. Slate&#146;s David Weigel <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/taylor_griffin_tries_to_unseat_walter_jones_what_does_north_carolina_s_gop.html">explains</a> Jones rebellion like this:</p>

    <p>Jones, who&#146;d lobbied the House to rename french fries as &#147;freedom fries&#148; in the run-up to the Iraq war, turned hard against the military campaign. He voted against war funding whenever it got to the floor, and with damp eyes he chastised Bush administration officials who, he believed, let soldiers die for a lie.</p>

    <p>Faced with the decision of voting with his party but also for more unnecessary spending and the likelihood of more of his constituents dying, Jones took the path of most resistance. Even now, the hallways leading to Jones&#146; congressional office are lined with photos of soldiers who died in the Iraq War. With all this in mind, it seems that Jones chose to risk his seat by voting against his party&#151;a decision we&#146;ve been told ruins the chance for reelection. However, this tale of voting mutiny leading to demise may not be true.</p>

    <p>While it&#146;s true that members of Congress overwhelmingly vote with their party and it&#146;s true that no one likes the dissident voter, it&#146;s not true that dissident voters experience adversity because of their voting choice.</p>

    <p>During the last five Congresses (2005-present), about 78% of congress members voted with their party more than 90% of the time.</p>

  <div class='sidebar'>
    <p>There are 600-1000 votes in every session of Congress. And each Congress&#151;that would be 109-113 since 2005&#151;has two sessions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='para'>
    <p>There could be many reasons why people vote along these party lines: coercion, desire for reelection, social pressure, or fundraising needs to name a few. While it&#146;s impossible to know if and/or how coercion and social pressure influence Congress, it is possible to measure factors such as fundraising and primary opposition to see if dissident voters actually receive repercussions.</p>

    <p>In watching the current campaign waged against Walter Jones, one could predict an uptick in primary opposition for these rebellious voters. However if that were the case, John Boehner himself would be facing a challenger&#151;at 86%, he has one of the lowest rates of voting with the Republican majority. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/politics/immigration-bill-hinges-on-new-obama-attitude-boehner-says.html">He even chastises</a> House Republicans for voting against the party, further contributing to this conformity voting myth.</p>

    <p>When the voting records of each member of the House and the Senate were compared to the likelihood of having a challenger in the following primary election, there was no trend. Simply put, there is no overall increased chance of primary opposition from your party no matter how often you vote against them.</p>

    <p>Each quartile represents one-quarter of the incumbents for whom voting records were compared. The first quartile is the bottom 25% of voters--those with the lowest rates for voting along party lines, and the fourth quartile is the top 25% of voters--those with the highest rates of voting along party lines.</p>
  </div>


  <div class='sidebar'>
    <p>Fundraising was used to determine whether or not each incumbent had a &#147;serious&#148; primary challenger in any given election. Based on funds raised, serious means that a challenger raised more than $50K in a House race and more than $100K in a Senate race.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='para'>
    <p>Given that there is no trend, perhaps we should tell Congress to vote as they see fit? Well, that is exactly what Walter Jones is doing. But in Jones&#146; special case, he&#146;s been made into a pariah&#151;even though he is often named as one of the most conservative voters in Congress by conservative organizations. Though Jones&#146; is voting conservatively and is theoretically upholding Republican ideals through this voting, he&#146;s being used as the poster child to tell a story of what happens when voting doesn&#146;t align&#151;too bad that story&#146;s not true.</p>

    <p>Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) was experiencing a similar bit of political warfare early in the 2014 primaries with opponent Liz Cheney trying to out-Republican him, though he is ranked one of the most conservative voters in the Senate.</p>

    <p>Digging further into the bounty of politalk, there is much rhetoric about campaign finance and fundraising these days. Fundraising ability is ostensibly another factor that would be affected if a member&#146;s party loyalty were under question. But again, there is no measurable affect.</p>

  </div>

    <div class='sidebar'>
    <p>To see if there was a correlation between voting patterns and funds raised in any given election, voting rate percent was charted on a scatter plot against the total funds received for each incumbent, as measured by the Federal Election Commission.</p>

    <p>There is no trend between voting percentage (how often a congress member votes with his or her party) and how much money they raise for their next election. This chart compares voting records from the 113th Congress to money raised for the upcoming 2014 mid-term elections. The fundrasising information for John Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Eric Cantor was removed since they were outliers in the amount of money they raised. </p>
  </div>



  <div class='para'>
    <p>Since fundraising ability does not depend on voting record (though fundraising ability does still heavily impact ability to win a race) and there&#146;s no affect on primary opposition based on voting record, what keeps Congress so divided? These conclusions have interesting insight on partisanship. Both the House and the Senate members vote with their party and keep Congress divided, but it&#146;s not clear why. There aren&#146;t measurable reasons explaining the divide&#151;so unless we are to assume there is a grand puppeteer keeping everyone in line, it seems that Congress is self-monitoring. </p>
